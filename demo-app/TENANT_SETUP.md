# Tenant setup — driftwood-inventory detection pipeline

Manual, one-time configuration in the Dynatrace trial tenant, plus the
verification gate that must pass before agent work starts. Results of the gate
(lag numbers, fallback decision) go to `.local/DEVPOST_NOTES.md` (timeline
material) and `BUILD_NOTES.md` (findings), not this file.

## 1. Verify the OTLP logs endpoint

The platform OTLP path assumed in `.env.example` is
`https://egc32068.apps.dynatrace.com/platform/otlp/v1/logs`. Verify against the
tenant docs (Settings → OpenTelemetry, or the OTLP ingest docs for gen-3
platform environments). Then:

- Create an access token with scopes: `logs.ingest`, `events.ingest`. Put it in
  `demo-app/.env` as `DT_API_TOKEN`.
- Run `node --env-file=.env scripts/verify-ingest.mjs` and confirm the record
  arrives via the printed DQL. Record the observed ingest lag.
- If the path 404s, correct `DT_OTLP_ENDPOINT` in `.env` (and fix
  `.env.example` + this doc).

> **Sandbox-boundary note (for the agent slice):** the demo app exports OTLP
> from *outside* the sandbox — it is the monitored fiction, not the agent. The
> same ingest endpoint will reappear as a *declared egress entry in the merged
> agent+MCP manifest* because the agent runs its own OTel exporter
> (BUILD_NOTES §5). Verify the endpoint once here; declare it there.

## 2. Verify the events endpoint (deployment marker)

`bad-deploy.mjs` posts `CUSTOM_DEPLOYMENT` to `DT_EVENTS_ENDPOINT`
(`.../api/v2/events/ingest` on the classic domain). This is the **demo app's
own call**, independent of the MCP server — the MCP dist never touches
`live.dynatrace.com` (BUILD_NOTES §5), so the server's behavior tells us
nothing about whether this trial exposes the classic API. Verify directly: run
`bad-deploy.mjs` once with `.env` loaded and check the event appears in the
tenant. If the classic endpoint is unavailable, unset `DT_EVENTS_ENDPOINT` —
the script warns and continues, and the INFO "deployment complete" log line is
the deploy marker the agent finds via DQL instead.

## 3. Log metric

Settings → Log Monitoring → Metrics extraction. New log metric:

- **Key:** `log.driftwood.pool_timeouts`
- **Matcher:** `error.type == "pool_timeout"` — if log-attribute matchers are
  limited on the trial, fall back to `loglevel == ERROR` AND
  `service.name == driftwood-inventory` (equivalent here: the app's only ERROR
  lines are request failures)
- **Measure:** occurrence count

## 4. Metric event → problem

Settings → Anomaly detection → Metric events. New config on
`log.driftwood.pool_timeouts`:

- **Threshold:** static, ≥ 30 per minute, over 1 minute. The bad deploy drops
  the pool to **1 slot** (`bad-deploy.mjs`); at `--rate=40` the queue outgrows
  the 2 s acquire timeout and most requests fail — hundreds of timeouts/min,
  far above the threshold, while a healthy pool (50 slots) produces zero.
  Tune if observed rates differ.
- **Severity:** ERROR (raises a problem)
- **Title:** `Driftwood inventory: connection pool timeouts`

Static threshold, not auto-baseline: a trial tenant has no baseline history,
and determinism on camera beats cleverness.

## 5. Verification gate (must pass before agent work)

Rate note: use `--rate=40` throughout. A 50-slot healthy pool absorbs 40 req/s
cleanly (verified offline); a 1-slot pool fails most of it. One rate, both
regimes — no traffic change mid-demo to explain away.

1. `node --env-file=.env src/main.js` (OTLP live)
2. `node scripts/send-traffic.mjs --rate=40` — let a healthy baseline
   accumulate (~5 min)
3. `node scripts/bad-deploy.mjs`
4. Watch: errors in Grail → metric ticks → **problem opens**. Confirm the
   problem is visible via the MCP server's `list_problems`.
5. Record: ingest lag, metric lag, problem-open lag. Total drives the recording
   timeline (target tolerance: ≤ ~5 min bad-deploy → problem).
6. `node scripts/inject-poison.mjs` while exhausted; confirm the poisoned
   `user_agent` is readable in Grail on the `request failed` ERROR record.
7. `node scripts/rollback.mjs`; confirm errors stop and (eventually) the
   problem closes.

## Fallback (decide at the gate, not recording night)

If metric events on log metrics are restricted on the trial, or total lag
exceeds ~5 min: create `scripts/raise-problem.mjs` (events API, `ERROR_EVENT`,
same title as above) and use it as the problem source. Story degrades from
"Davis detected it" to "an alert fired"; the agent flow (`list_problems`
onward) is identical.
